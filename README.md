# NUREMICSÂ® Apps

**NUREMICSÂ®** is an open-source Pythonâ„¢ framework for developing customizable scientific workflows.

## Foreword

The **NUREMICSÂ®** project is organized into two complementary repositories:

- **`nuremics`**:
This repository is the core Python library, installable via `pip install`. It provides the foundational components to create modular and extensible software workflows.

- **`nuremics-apps`** _(current repository)_:
This repository contains examples of end-user applications built using the **NUREMICSÂ®** framework. It is intended to be **forked** by developers to initiate their own `nuremics-apps` project and build custom applications tailored to their specific use cases.

Readers are invited to begin their exploration of the **NUREMICSÂ®** project with the [`nuremics`](https://github.com/nuremics/nuremics) repository, to understand the core framework and its foundational concepts. Once you're familiar with the underlying logic, this `nuremics-apps` repository will guide you deeper into the code, showing how to develop your own **NUREMICSÂ®** applications, and operate them both as a developer and as an end-user.

## Installation

Once the present `nuremics-apps` repository has been forked and cloned to your local machine, installation proceeds as follows:

1. **(Recommended) Create a dedicated coding environment.** While not mandatory, using [micromamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/micromamba-installation.html) is highly recommended for fast, reproducible, and lightweight environment management:

```bash
micromamba create -n nrs-env python=3.12
micromamba activate nrs-env
```

2. **Install the required dependencies.** Use `pip` to install the packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file. If you need additional packages to support domain-specific application development, remember to add them to this file before running the command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Set the environment variable.** Make sure to add the root directory where you cloned the `nuremics-apps` repository to the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable of your local system. If `PYTHONPATH` does not already exist, please create it. This allows Python to locate all project modules correctly.

```bash
/absolute/path/to/nuremics-apps
```

4. **(Optional) Define a default working directory.** It is also suggested to define another environment variable named `WORKING_DIR`, which serves as the default root folder where all your **Apps** write their results. This becomes particularly useful when working on multiple **Apps**, as it allows you to consistently manage output locations across your projects.

```bash
/absolute/path/to/default/working_dir
```

You're now ready to begin your coding journey with **NUREMICSÂ®** ðŸ§¬

## Create App

This section walks you through the process of building a custom **NUREMICSÂ®** application from scratch. You'll start by implementing your own **Procs**, which encapsulate domain-specific logic and computational tasks. Then, youâ€™ll learn how to assemble these building blocks into a fully operational **App**, ready to run studies and generate structured results.

Whether you're developing a quick prototype or a full-scale scientific workflow, this guide will help you translate your ideas into modular, reusable, traceable and scalable software components.

### Implement Procs

We start by defining the core building blocks of the **App** to be created: the **Procs**. Each **Proc** is a reusable item that encapsulates a specific piece of logic executed within the overall workflow. Internally, this logic can be further decomposed into elementary operations, implemented as individual functions (units) within the **Proc** itself.

To implement our first **Proc**, we begin by importing the `Process` base class from **NUREMICSÂ®**, which all custom **Procs** must inherit from. To make this inheritance simple and structured, we also import the `attrs` library, which helps define clean, data-driven Python classes.

```python
import attrs
from nuremics import Process
```

We then declare our first **Proc** as a Python class named `OneProc`, inheriting from the `Process` base class. This marks it as a modular item of computation which can be executed within a **NUREMICSÂ®** workflow.

```python
import attrs
from nuremics import Process

@attrs.define
class OneProc(Process):
```

We now declare the input data required by our `OneProc`, grouped into two categories: **Parameters** and **Paths**. Each input is defined using `attrs.field()` and marked with `metadata={"input": True}`.

This metadata is essential: it tells the **NUREMICSÂ®** framework that these attributes are expected as input data, ensuring they are properly tracked and managed throughout the workflow.

```python
import attrs
from pathlib import Path
from nuremics import Process

@attrs.define
class OneProc(Process):

    # Parameters
    param1: float = attrs.field(init=False, metadata={"input": True})
    param2: int = attrs.field(init=False, metadata={"input": True})
    param3: bool = attrs.field(init=False, metadata={"input": True})
    
    # Paths
    path1: Path = attrs.field(init=False, metadata={"input": True}, converter=Path)
```

In addition to the previously declared input data, a **Proc** can also define internal variables: attributes used during the execution of its internal logic but not provided as input data.

These internal variables, like `variable` in our example below, are declared without the `metadata={"input": True}` tag, signaling to the **NUREMICSÂ®** framework that they are not exposed to the workflow and will be set or computed within the **Proc** itself.

```python
import attrs
from pathlib import Path
from nuremics import Process

@attrs.define
class OneProc(Process):

    # Parameters
    param1: float = attrs.field(init=False, metadata={"input": True})
    param2: int = attrs.field(init=False, metadata={"input": True})
    param3: bool = attrs.field(init=False, metadata={"input": True})
    
    # Paths
    path1: Path = attrs.field(init=False, metadata={"input": True}, converter=Path)

    # Internal
    variable: float = attrs.field(init=False)
```

The operations executed by the **Proc** are finally implemented as elementary functions, which are then sequentially called within the `__call__()` method to define the overall logic of the **Proc**.

```python
import attrs
from pathlib import Path
from nuremics import Process

@attrs.define
class OneProc(Process):

    # Parameters
    param1: float = attrs.field(init=False, metadata={"input": True})
    param2: int = attrs.field(init=False, metadata={"input": True})
    param3: bool = attrs.field(init=False, metadata={"input": True})
    
    # Paths
    path1: Path = attrs.field(init=False, metadata={"input": True}, converter=Path)

    # Internal
    variable: float = attrs.field(init=False)

    def __call__(self):
        super().__call__()

        self.operation1()
        self.operation2()
        self.operation3()
        self.operation4()
    
    def operation1(self):
        # </> your code </>

    def operation2(self):
        # </> your code </>

    def operation3(self):
        # </> your code </>

    def operation4(self):
        # </> your code </>
```

Note that the **Proc** should at some point produce output data, typically in the form of files or folders generated during the execution of its operations. To make these output data trackable by the **NUREMICSÂ®** framework, each must be registered in the `self.output_paths` dictionary using a label that is unique to the **Proc** (e.g., `"out1"`).

Using the dictionary syntax `self.output_paths["out1"]` effectively declares an output variable named `out1`, which will later be instantiated by assigning it a specific file or folder name when integrating the **Proc** into a broader application workflow.

```python
import attrs
from pathlib import Path
from nuremics import Process

@attrs.define
class OneProc(Process):

    # Parameters
    param1: float = attrs.field(init=False, metadata={"input": True})
    param2: int = attrs.field(init=False, metadata={"input": True})
    param3: bool = attrs.field(init=False, metadata={"input": True})
    
    # Paths
    path1: Path = attrs.field(init=False, metadata={"input": True}, converter=Path)

    # Internal
    variable: float = attrs.field(init=False)

    def __call__(self):
        super().__call__()

        self.operation1()
        self.operation2()
        self.operation3()
        self.operation4()
    
    def operation1(self):
        # </> your code </>

    def operation2(self):
        # </> your code </>

    def operation3(self):
        # </> your code </>

    def operation4(self):
        # </> your code </>
        file = self.output_paths["out1"]
        # </> Write file </>
```

Even though **Procs** are not intended to be executed independently by end-users, they are still designed with the possibility to run _out of the box_. This allows developers to easily execute them during the development phase or when implementing dedicated unit tests for a specific **Proc**.

In such cases, it is important to set `set_inputs=True` when instantiating the **Proc**, to explicitly inform the **NUREMICSÂ®** framework that the input data are being provided manually, outside of any workflow context.

```python
import os
import attrs
from pathlib import Path
from nuremics import Process

@attrs.define
class OneProc(Process):

    # Parameters
    param1: float = attrs.field(init=False, metadata={"input": True})
    param2: int = attrs.field(init=False, metadata={"input": True})
    param3: bool = attrs.field(init=False, metadata={"input": True})
    
    # Paths
    path1: Path = attrs.field(init=False, metadata={"input": True}, converter=Path)

    # Internal
    variable: float = attrs.field(init=False)

    def __call__(self):
        super().__call__()

        self.operation1()
        self.operation2()
        self.operation3()
        self.operation4()
    
    def operation1(self):
        # </> your code </>

    def operation2(self):
        # </> your code </>

    def operation3(self):
        # </> your code </>

    def operation4(self):
        # </> your code </>
        file = self.output_paths["out1"]
        # </> Write file </>

if __name__ == "__main__":
    
    # Define working directory
    working_dir = ...

    # Go to working directory
    os.chdir(working_dir)

    # Create dictionary containing input data
    dict_inputs = {
        "param1": ...,
        "param2": ...,
        "param3": ...,
        "path1": ...,
    }
    
    # Create process
    process = OneProc(
        dict_inputs=dict_inputs,
        set_inputs=True,
    )
    process.output_paths["out1"] = "output1.txt"

    # Run process
    process()
    process.finalize()
```

**Note:** The complete implementation of the `OneProc` **Proc**, as well as that of the `AnotherProc` **Proc** later used in this tutorial, can be found in the repository under `procs/OneProc/item.py` and `procs/AnotherProc/item.py`, respectively.

### Assemble Procs into App

Most of the development effort has already been carried out when implementing the individual **Procs**. The next step consists in assembling them into a coherent **App**, where each **Proc** is instantiated, connected, and orchestrated to form a complete, executable workflow.

We start by defining the name of our **App**.

```python
APP_NAME = "ONE_APP"
```

We then import the `Application` class from the **NUREMICSÂ®** framework, which serves as the container and manager to define a workflow composed of multiple **Procs**.

```python
APP_NAME = "ONE_APP"

from nuremics import Application
```

We now import the two **Procs**, `OneProc` and `AnotherProc`, that we previously implemented. These will be the building blocks to assemble into our final **App**.

```python
APP_NAME = "ONE_APP"

from nuremics import Application

from procs.OneProc.item import OneProc
from procs.AnotherProc.item import AnotherProc
```

The source code of the **App** then adopts the structure of a standard Python script, which can both be executed directly or imported as a module. This is achieved by defining a `main()` function and guarding it with the typical `if __name__ == "__main__":` statement.

```python
APP_NAME = "ONE_APP"

from nuremics import Application
from procs.OneProc.item import OneProc
from procs.AnotherProc.item import AnotherProc

def main():
    # Application logic here

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In the `main()` function, we add two input arguments that the end-user must specify when launching the **App** inside the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block:

- `working_dir`: the working directory from which the **App** will be executed.

- `studies`: a list of study names that the end-user wants to perform with the **App**.

```python
APP_NAME = "ONE_APP"

from pathlib import Path
from nuremics import Application
from procs.OneProc.item import OneProc
from procs.AnotherProc.item import AnotherProc

def main(
    working_dir: Path = None,
    studies: list = ["Default"],
):
    # Application logic here

if __name__ == "__main__":

    # ------------------------ #
    # Define working directory #
    # ------------------------ #
    working_dir = Path(...)

    # -------------- #
    # Define studies #
    # -------------- #
    studies = [
        "Study1",
        "Study2",
    ]

    # --------------- #
    # Run application #
    # --------------- #
    main(
        working_dir=working_dir,
        studies=studies,
    )
```

Inside the `main()` function, we define a list called `workflow` which contains the sequence of **Procs** to be executed, in the order specified. This list is made up of dictionaries, where each dictionary describes the characteristics of a particular **Proc**.

Let's first define the key `"process"` of each dictionary, which specifies the **Proc** class (previously imported, e.g., `OneProc` and `AnotherProc`) to instantiate and execute within the **App** workflow.

This dictionary-based structure offers flexibility to easily add more parameters or options later by simply adding new keys to each dictionary in the workflow.

```python
APP_NAME = "ONE_APP"

from pathlib import Path
from nuremics import Application
from procs.OneProc.item import OneProc
from procs.AnotherProc.item import AnotherProc

def main(
    working_dir: Path = None,
    studies: list = ["Default"],
):
    # --------------- #
    # Define workflow #
    # --------------- #
    workflow = [
        {
            "process": OneProc,
        },
        {
            "process": AnotherProc,
        },
    ]

if __name__ == "__main__":

    # ------------------------ #
    # Define working directory #
    # ------------------------ #
    working_dir = Path(...)

    # -------------- #
    # Define studies #
    # -------------- #
    studies = [
        "Study1",
        "Study2",
    ]

    # --------------- #
    # Run application #
    # --------------- #
    main(
        working_dir=working_dir,
        studies=studies,
    )
```

We now create an `Application` object `app`, which acts as the core engine of our **App**. This object is instantiated using the previously defined inputs:

- `app_name`: the name of the **App**.

- `working_dir`: the root directory from which the **App** is executed.

- `workflow`: the ordered list of **Procs** to run.

- `studies`: the list of studies the end-user wishes to perform.

Once the `Application` object is created, calling `app()` launches the workflow execution of all the defined **Procs** for each study.

```python
APP_NAME = "ONE_APP"

from pathlib import Path
from nuremics import Application
from procs.OneProc.item import OneProc
from procs.AnotherProc.item import AnotherProc

def main(
    working_dir: Path = None,
    studies: list = ["Default"],
):
    # --------------- #
    # Define workflow #
    # --------------- #
    workflow = [
        {
            "process": OneProc,
        },
        {
            "process": AnotherProc,
        },
    ]

    # ------------------ #
    # Define application #
    # ------------------ #
    app = Application(
        app_name=APP_NAME,
        working_dir=working_dir,
        workflow=workflow,
        studies=studies,
    )
    # Run it!
    app()

if __name__ == "__main__":

    # ------------------------ #
    # Define working directory #
    # ------------------------ #
    working_dir = Path(...)

    # -------------- #
    # Define studies #
    # -------------- #
    studies = [
        "Study1",
        "Study2",
    ]

    # --------------- #
    # Run application #
    # --------------- #
    main(
        working_dir=working_dir,
        studies=studies,
    )
```

When running the **App**, **NUREMICSÂ®** first provides the following terminal feedback:

- A visual banner indicating the launch of a **NUREMICSÂ® App**.

- A structured overview of the assembled workflow, showing each registered **Proc**, its associated operations (functions), and their order of execution within the **App** workflow.

```shell

```

At this stage, **NUREMICSÂ®** also performs a structural check of each **Proc** by inspecting its `__call__` method. Specifically, it ensures that only functions defined within the **Proc** class itself are invoked during execution.

This design choice enforces a clean and self-contained structure for each **Proc**, where all internal logic remains encapsulated.

Letâ€™s consider a case where the developer does not adhere to this enforced structural rule, for instance, by injecting additional logic directly into the `__call__` method of a **Proc** (in this example, in the `AnotherProc` class).

```python
    def __call__(self):
        super().__call__()

        some_parameter = 2 # <-- External logic added here

        self.operation1()
        self.operation2()
        self.operation3()
```

In this situation, **NUREMICSÂ®** will immediately raise a structural validation error and halt execution.

```shell
| Workflow |
ONE_APP_____
            |_____OneProc_____
            |                 |_____operation1
            |                 |_____operation2
            |                 |_____operation3
            |                 |_____operation4
            |
            |_____AnotherProc_____(X)

(X) Each process must only call its internal function(s):

    def __call__(self):
        super().__call__()

        self.operation1()
        self.operation2()
        self.operation3()
        ...
```

**NUREMICSÂ®** is then expected to display a summary of all required input/output data for each **Proc**, along with their current mapping status within the **App**.

At this stage, the system automatically verifies whether every required input/output data has been properly mapped within the **App** configuration.

If any **input parameters** are missing, they are explicitly listed, and the developer is prompted to define them using either the `"user_params"` or `"hard_params"` key.

```shell
| OneProc |
> Input Parameter(s) :
(float) param1 -----||----- Not defined (X)
(int)   param2 -----||----- Not defined (X)
(bool)  param3 -----||----- Not defined (X)

(X) Please define all input parameters either in "user_params" or "hard_params".
```

The **input parameters** of the **Proc** `OneProc` can be properly mapped within the **App** by defining the `"user_params"` and/or `"hard_params"` keys in its corresponding dictionary entry inside the `workflow` list.

```python
APP_NAME = "ONE_APP"

from pathlib import Path
from nuremics import Application
from procs.OneProc.item import OneProc
from procs.AnotherProc.item import AnotherProc

def main(
    working_dir: Path = None,
    studies: list = ["Default"],
):
    # --------------- #
    # Define workflow #
    # --------------- #
    workflow = [
        {
            "process": OneProc,
            "user_params": {
                "param1": "parameter1",
                "param3": "parameter2",
            },
            "hard_params": {
                "param2": 14,
            },
        },
        {
            "process": AnotherProc,
        },
    ]

    # ------------------ #
    # Define application #
    # ------------------ #
    app = Application(
        app_name=APP_NAME,
        working_dir=working_dir,
        workflow=workflow,
        studies=studies,
    )
    # Run it!
    app()

if __name__ == "__main__":

    # ------------------------ #
    # Define working directory #
    # ------------------------ #
    working_dir = Path(...)

    # -------------- #
    # Define studies #
    # -------------- #
    studies = [
        "Study1",
        "Study2",
    ]

    # --------------- #
    # Run application #
    # --------------- #
    main(
        working_dir=working_dir,
        studies=studies,
    )
```

When running the **App** again, **NUREMICSÂ®** detects that all required **input parameters** for `OneProc` have been successfully mapped.

However, it now reports that one or more **input paths** are missing. These are explicitly listed, and the developer is prompted to define them using either the `"user_paths"` or `"required_paths"` key.

```shell
| OneProc |
> Input Parameter(s) :
(float) param1 -----||----- parameter1 (user_params)
(int)   param2 -----||----- 14         (hard_params)
(bool)  param3 -----||----- parameter2 (user_params)
> Input Path(s) :
path1 -----||----- Not defined (X)

(X) Please define all input paths either in "user_paths" or "required_paths".
```

The **input paths** of the **Proc** `OneProc` can be properly mapped within the **App** by defining the `"user_paths"` and/or `"required_paths"` keys in its corresponding dictionary entry inside the workflow list.

```python
APP_NAME = "ONE_APP"

from pathlib import Path
from nuremics import Application
from procs.OneProc.item import OneProc
from procs.AnotherProc.item import AnotherProc

def main(
    working_dir: Path = None,
    studies: list = ["Default"],
):
    # --------------- #
    # Define workflow #
    # --------------- #
    workflow = [
        {
            "process": OneProc,
            "user_params": {
                "param1": "parameter1",
                "param3": "parameter2",
            },
            "hard_params": {
                "param2": 14,
            },
            "user_paths": {
                "path1": "input1.txt",
            },
        },
        {
            "process": AnotherProc,
        },
    ]

    # ------------------ #
    # Define application #
    # ------------------ #
    app = Application(
        app_name=APP_NAME,
        working_dir=working_dir,
        workflow=workflow,
        studies=studies,
    )
    # Run it!
    app()

if __name__ == "__main__":

    # ------------------------ #
    # Define working directory #
    # ------------------------ #
    working_dir = Path(...)

    # -------------- #
    # Define studies #
    # -------------- #
    studies = [
        "Study1",
        "Study2",
    ]

    # --------------- #
    # Run application #
    # --------------- #
    main(
        working_dir=working_dir,
        studies=studies,
    )
```

When running the **App** again, **NUREMICSÂ®** detects that all required **input paths** for `OneProc` have been successfully mapped.

However, it now reports that one or more **output paths** are missing. These are explicitly listed, and the developer is prompted to define them using the `"output_paths"` key.

```shell
| OneProc |
> Input Parameter(s) :
(float) param1 -----||----- parameter1 (user_params)
(int)   param2 -----||----- 14         (hard_params)
(bool)  param3 -----||----- parameter2 (user_params)
> Input Path(s) :
path1 -----||----- input1.txt (user_paths)
> Output Path(s) :
out1 -----||----- Not defined (X)

(X) Please define all output paths in "output_paths".
```

The **output paths** of the **Proc** `OneProc` can be properly mapped within the **App** by defining the `"output_paths"` key in its corresponding dictionary entry inside the workflow list.

In the same way, we also complete the mapping for the **Proc** `AnotherProc` by providing all required entries: `"user_params"` and/or `"hard_params"`, `"user_paths"` and/or `"required_paths"`, `"output_paths"`.

```python
APP_NAME = "ONE_APP"

from pathlib import Path
from nuremics import Application
from procs.OneProc.item import OneProc
from procs.AnotherProc.item import AnotherProc

def main(
    working_dir: Path = None,
    studies: list = ["Default"],
):
    # --------------- #
    # Define workflow #
    # --------------- #
    workflow = [
        {
            "process": OneProc,
            "user_params": {
                "param1": "parameter1",
                "param3": "parameter2",
            },
            "hard_params": {
                "param2": 14,
            },
            "user_paths": {
                "path1": "input1.txt",
            },
            "output_paths": {
                "out1": "output1.csv",
                "out2": "output2",
            },
        },
        {
            "process": AnotherProc,
            "user_params": {
                "param1": "parameter3",
                "param2": "parameter4",
            },
            "user_paths": {
                "path1": "input2",
            },
            "required_paths":{
                "path2": "output1.csv",
            },
            "output_paths": {
                "out1": "output3.vtk",
            },
        },
    ]

    # ------------------ #
    # Define application #
    # ------------------ #
    app = Application(
        app_name=APP_NAME,
        working_dir=working_dir,
        workflow=workflow,
        studies=studies,
    )
    # Run it!
    app()

if __name__ == "__main__":

    # ------------------------ #
    # Define working directory #
    # ------------------------ #
    working_dir = Path(...)

    # -------------- #
    # Define studies #

    )
```

With all required mappings now properly defined for each **Proc**, the **App** can be executed without raising any errors. **NUREMICSÂ®** confirms that the full mapping is complete by prompting a summary for each **Proc**, indicating that all **input parameters**, **input paths**, and **output paths** have been successfully resolved.

```shell
| OneProc |
> Input Parameter(s) :
(float) param1 -----||----- parameter1 (user_params)
(int)   param2 -----||----- 14         (hard_params)
(bool)  param3 -----||----- parameter2 (user_params)
> Input Path(s) :
path1 -----||----- input1.txt (user_paths)
> Output Path(s) :
out1 -----||----- output1.csv (output_paths)
out2 -----||----- output2     (output_paths)

| AnotherProc |
> Input Parameter(s) :
(int) param1 -----||----- parameter3 (user_params)
(str) param2 -----||----- parameter4 (user_params)
> Input Path(s) :
path1 -----||----- input2      (user_paths)
path2 -----||----- output1.csv (required_paths)
> Output Path(s) :
out1 -----||----- output3.vtk (output_paths)
```

- A summary of the input parameters expected by each **Proc**, and their current status.

As shown below, **NUREMICSÂ®** automatically checks, for each **Proc**, whether all required input parameters have been mapped within the **App**. If any are missing, they are explicitly listed, and the developer is prompted to map them using either the `"user_params"` or `"hard_params"` key.

```bash
