# NUREMICS® apps

**NUREMICS®** is an open-source Python™ framework for developing customizable scientific workflows.

## Foreword

The **NUREMICS®** project is organized into two complementary repositories:

- **[`nuremics`](https://github.com/nuremics/nuremics)**:
This repository is the core Python library, installable via `pip install`. It provides the foundational components to create modular and extensible software workflows.

- **`nuremics-apps`** _(current repository)_:
This repository contains examples of end-user applications built using the **NUREMICS®** framework. It is intended to be **forked** by developers to initiate their own `nuremics-apps` project and build custom applications tailored to their specific use cases.

Readers are encouraged to begin their exploration of the **NUREMICS®** project with the `nuremics` repository to understand the core framework and its foundational building blocks, before diving into the examples and applications provided in `nuremics-apps`.

Developers are invited to treat `nuremics` as the core engine, and to use `nuremics-apps` as a starting point for developing and maintaining their own scientific software built on top of the **NUREMICS®** framework.
